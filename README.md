# About this Repo
I often find myself in need of simple utilities that only exist as full blown executables found online. It takes time to thoroughly vet the source and even then you can only do so much to be sure something is safe. This has led to the creation of several scripts (some of them quite obscure) that I use on my PC from time to time. I have made an effort to clean them up to be more clear to others, but keep in mind that most of these were written from my own perspective without much thought given to maintainability.
